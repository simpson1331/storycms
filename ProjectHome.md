StoryCMS will use the Google App Engine (Python flavor) in an attempt to provide a website for publications and smaller newspapers.

My inspiration is EllingtonCMS and this will most likely be a very POOR man's version.  Similar to Ellington, StoryCMS will allow you to handle stories, blogs, comments, listings, and various media types.
